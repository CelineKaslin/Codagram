        <p>JavaScript ("JS" for short) is a full-fledged dynamic programming language that,
          when applied to an HTML document, can provide dynamic interactivity on websites. It was invented
          by Brendan Eich, co-founder of the Mozilla project, the Mozilla Foundation, and the Mozilla Corporation.
          JavaScript is incredibly versatile. You can start small, with carousels, image galleries, fluctuating layouts,
          and responses to button clicks. With more experience, you'll be able to create games, animated 2D and 3D graphics,
          comprehensive database-driven apps, and much more!</p>

        <h3>Data types: Numbers, Strings, Boolean, Null, Undefined, Symbols</h3>
        <p>In JavaScript, your information (or data) can come in different types.
          There are six primitives data types but right now we're interested just on three of them:<br>
          - Integer : any number üî¢<br>
          - Boolean : true or false üëå<br>
          - Strings : any text üÜí</p>

          <h3>Strings</h3>
          <p>In programming a string is a representation of text. Every time we want to display something
            on the screen we need to write our text as a string. To do that we need to encapsulate our text
            with single or double quotes exactly like this: "This is a string" or 'This is a string'.</p>

          <h3>Integers</h3>
          <p>Integers in programming are basically numbers. Numbers don't need to be encapsulated
            like text so you can simply write the number you want and it will be displayed on the screen.<br>
            You can do all the classical operation you learned at school with the integer.<br>
            There are 4 main arithmetic operators we're going to focus on: Addition, Subtraction, Division,
            Multiplication. In addition to this, there is also a modulo operator: % which is to the left over of an division.<br>
            So for example 5 % 3 = 2.
            Finally, you can also use exponents in JavaScript by using **.<br>
            For example : 2 ** 3 = 8</p>

          <h3>Booleans</h3>
          <p>In programming the Boolean Data Type is a data type that has two possible values intended to represent
            the two truth values: True or False. If we want to check if a person is hungry for example we can use a
            boolean value to output whether that person is hungry or not.</p>

          <h3>Variables</h3>
          <p>One of the most basic concepts in computer programming is a variable.
            You can think of a variable as a word or name that grasps a single value.
            For example, let's say you needed the number 25 multiple times, you can just
            store it in a variable and that variable will remember the number 25 for you.
            To create a variable you simply need to use the keyword let or var, give a name to the variable, put
            an equal sign and on the right hand side put the data that you want to store.
            Example: let name = 'Codagram' to store a string or: let age = 10 to store a number.</p>

          <h3>Arrays</h3>
          <p>Arrays are ways to store data inside the code. They are like a list of data.<br> An example of a variable storing an array would be
            var a = [195,"Hello World",true]. Arrays can store any type of data, even other arrays!. This one stores an integer, a string
            and a boolean value. A quick way to display a value from the array a on your screen it would be: console.log(a[0]), the output
            would be 195 as arrays start from 0 and count onwards. You could also add things into the array with the .push inbuilt method. For example
            if we did a.push([1,2]), the new array would be a = [195,"Hello World",true,[1,2]]. The .delete method does the opposite of the .push method.

          <h3>The .push inbuilt method</h3>
          <p>You could also add things into the array with the .push inbuilt method. Take the example above for instance. If we did a.push([1,2]), the new array would
          be a = [195,"Hello World",true,[1,2]].</p>

          <h3>Hashes</h3>
          <p>Hashes are similar to arrays in that they hold data. However, they are using a key/value pair. Perfect for online dictionaries!<br>
            An example of this would be: let dictionary = { one: "uno", two: "dos", three: "tres" }. If we type puts dictionary["one"], the output would be uno.

          <h3>Math</h3>
          <p>JavaScript can do a lot of powerfull things that you will discover. It can also do
            all the math you learned about in school. There are 4 main arithmetic operators we're going
            to focus on: Addition, Subtraction, Division, Multiplication. In addition to this, there is
            also a % operator which equates to the remainder of an operation. So for example 5 % 3 = 2.</p>

          <h3>The JavaScript console</h3>
          <p>The console object gives you access to the browser‚Äôs console. It lets you output strings, arrays, and objects that help debug your code. The console is part of
            the window object, and is supplied by the Browser Object Model (BOM). We can get access to the console in one of two ways:</br>
             window.console.log('This works') / console.log('So does this').</p>

         <h3>Inbuilt methods</h3>
         <p>There are a number of inbuilt methods in JavaScript. This means you can access them without ever typing a word. An example of this would be
           the methods .includes() or .startsWith(). Both of these return a boolean value. The first method checks whether or not the object inside the parentheses
           is included anywhere in the object it's called on. On the other hand, the second method checks whether the value inside the parentheses is what starts
           the objects that is called.

          <h3>The '.length()' method</h3>
          <p> Methods are used to give some behaviour to our programs. If you have a string and you feel lazy to count how long is that string,
            then comes in handy the '.length' method. You can simply use this method to output the exact number of characters contained in that string.
            Example: we have 'Hello World', to count the length of this string we can simply do: 'Hello World'.length() and it will output
            the number 11 (it also counts spaces). Pretty simple, right?</p>

          <h3>The '.reverse()' method</h3>
          <p>The '.reverse()' method is called the same way '.length()' is, but instead of asking JavaScript to tell you how long a string is,
            it spits out a backwards version of the string you gave it. For instance, we have our string 'Hello World'
            and we want to have it reversed, we can use the '.reverse' method.
            Example: 'Hello World'.reverse() will output 'dlroW olleH'.</p>

          <h3>'.toUpperCase()' & '.toLowerCase()'</h3>
          <p>Let's try one more method (er, two methods). As you might have guessed, the '.toUpperCase()' and '.toLowerCase()' methods convert a string to ALL
            UPPER CASE or all lower case, respectively.
            Example: 'Hello World'.toUpperCase() will output 'HELLO WORLD'.</p>

          <h3>Classes</h3>
          <p>Imagine you were an object that is an instance of the class Person. In a certain way, you actually are. Since you are a person, you are able
            to remember your own name and able to do something with it. When asked, you can return your name to whoever called it. In the same way, methods
            can interact with instances of classes. In the code, every classes must have a keyword end that concludes its content. Typically, methods are used to
            interact with instances of classes in larger scale applications.</p>

          <h3>Comments</h3>
          <p>The '//' sign is for comments in JavaScript. A comment is a bit of text that JavaScript won't try to run as code: it's just for us to remember
            what is doing a piece of code in case we forget and for other programmers who want to collaborate on the same project.
            Example: //'this is a comment and will not appear on the screen'.</p>
