        <p>JavaScript ("JS" for short) is a full-fledged dynamic programming language that,
          when applied to an HTML document, can provide dynamic interactivity on websites.<br>
          It was invented by Brendan Eich, co-founder of the Mozilla project, the Mozilla Foundation, and the Mozilla Corporation in ??? in ??City.<br>
          JavaScript is incredibly versatile. You can start small, with carousels, image galleries, fluctuating layouts,and responses to button clicks.<br>
          With more experience, you'll be able to even create games, animated 2D and 3D graphics, and much more!</p>

        <h3>Data types: Numbers, Strings, Boolean</h3>
        <p>In JavaScript, your information (or data) can come in different types.
          There are six primitives data types but right now we will focus just on three of them:<br>
          - Integer : any number üî¢<br>
          - Boolean : true or false üëå<br>
          - Strings : any text üÜí</p>

          <h3>Strings</h3>
          <p>In programming a string is a representation of text. Every time we want to display something
            on the screen we need to write our text as a string. To do that we need to encapsulate our text
            with single or double quotes (single quotes are more used in JS) exactly like this: "This is a string" or 'This is a string'.</p>

          <h3>Integers</h3>
          <p>Integers in programming are basically numbers. Numbers don't need to be encapsulated
            like text so you can simply write the number you want and it will be displayed on the screen.<br>
            You can do all the classical operation you learned at school with the integer.<br>
            There are 4 main arithmetic operators we're going to focus on: Addition, Subtraction, Division,
            Multiplication. In addition to this, there is also a modulo operator: % which is to the left over of an division.<br>
            So for example 5 % 3 = 2.
            Finally, you can also use exponents in JavaScript by using **.<br>
            For example : 2 ** 3 = 8</p>

          <h3>Booleans</h3>
          <p>In programming the Boolean Data Type is a data type that has two possible values intended to represent
            the two truth values: True or False ?? capital or not ?. <br>
            If we want to check if a person is hungry for example we can use a
            boolean value to output whether that person is hungry or not.</p>

          <h3>Variables</h3>
          <p>One of the most basic concepts in computer programming is a variable.
            You can think of a variable as a word or name that grasps a single value.
            For example, let's say you needed the number 25 multiple times, you can just store it in a variable and that variable will remember the number 25 for you.<br>
            To create a variable you simply need to use the keyword let or var, give a name to the variable, put
            an equal sign and on its right and to write the data that you want to store.<br>
            Example: let name = 'Codagram' name is the variable which is storing the "Codagram" string<br>
            Or: var age = 10 age is the variable which is storing the integer 10.</p>

          <h3>The JavaScript console</h3>
          <p>The console object gives you access to the browser‚Äôs console. It lets you output what you want to on the screen.<br>
            The console is part of the window object of your browser. So to logout something, you can do in one of two ways:</br>
            window.console.log('This works') or console.log('So does this').</p>


          <h3>The .length() method</h3>to the object we are working with. We say that we are calling a method on an object.<br>
          If you have a string and you feel lazy to count how long is that string,
            then comes in handy the .length() method. You can simply use this method to output the exact number of characters contained in that string.
            Example: we have 'Hello World', to count the length of this string we can simply do: "Hello World".length and it will output
            the length 11 (it also counts spaces).<br>
            Pretty simple, right?
            You can also use this method on array, that we gonna speak about on the next topic</p>

          <h3>Arrays</h3>
          <p>Arrays are ways to store data inside the code. They are like a list of data.<br>
            An example of a variable storing an array would be var a = [5,"Hi there",false]. Arrays can store any type of data, even other arrays!. This one stores an integer, a string
            and a boolean value.<br>
            To acces to an item inside it's easy. It would be: console.log(a[0]), the output
            would be 5 as arrays start from 0 and count onwards.<br><br>
            You could also add things into the array with the .push inbuilt method.<br>
            For example if we did a.push([18,62,'integer']), the new array would be a = [5,"Hi there",false,[18,62, 'integer']]. The .delete method does the opposite of the .push method.

          <h3>Hashes</h3>
          <p>Hashes are similar to arrays in that they hold data. However, they are using a key/value pair. It is a bit like a dictionary.<br>
            You can access a specific value in a hash by searching up its key.<br>
            An example of this would be: let h = { one: "uno", two: "dos", three: "tres" }.<br>
            If we type puts h["one"], the output would be uno.

          <h3>The .reverse() method</h3>
          <p>The .reverse() method is called the same way .length() is, but instead of asking JavaScript to tell you how long a string is,
            it spits out a backwards version of the string you gave it. For instance, we have our string 'Hello World'
            and we want to have it reversed, we can use the .reverse() method.<br>
            Example: 'Hello World'.reverse() will output 'dlroW olleH'.</p>

          <h3>.toUpperCase() & .toLowerCase()</h3>
          <p>Let's try two more methods. As you might have guessed, the .toUpperCase() and .toLowerCase() methods convert a string to ALL UPPER CASE or all lower case, respectively.<br>
            Example: 'Hello World'.toUpperCase() will output 'HELLO WORLD'<br>
            "HELLO WORLD".toLowerCase() will output 'hello world'</p>

         <h3>Inbuilt methods</h3>
         <p>There are a number of inbuilt methods in JavaScript. This means you can access them without ever typing a word. An example of this would be
           the methods .includes() or .startsWith().<br>
          Both of these return a boolean value.<br>
          The first method checks whether or not the given value inside the parentheses is included anywhere in the object.<br>
          The second method checks whether or not the string starts with the given value inside parentheses of the method.<br>
          Example : 'Dog'.startswith('D') will output true</p>

          <h3>Classes</h3>
          <p>Imagine you were an object that is an instance of the class Person. In a certain way, you actually are. Let me explain better.<br>
            Let's say that a class is something inside what you can wrap the values of a same kind. In our case the class will be Person and inside will be wrapped all the persons in the world.<br>
            Since you are a person, you are able to remember your own name and able to do something with it.<br>
            When asked, you can return your name to whoever called it. In the same way, methods
            can interact with instances of classes.</p>

          <h3>Comments</h3>
          <p>The // sign is used to make comments in JavaScript. A comment is a bit of text that JavaScript won't try to run as code: it's just for us to remember. It can be useful to use to remember something that you have done for example and also for other programmers who want to collaborate on the same project.<br>
            Example: //this is a comment and will not appear on the screen.</p>
