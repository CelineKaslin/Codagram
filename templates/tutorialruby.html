    <div class="introduction">
      <p>Ruby is a programming language, and yes also a precious stone!
        It is considered as a good option to start with because it is designed to be
        read and written almost like English.
        This language was created by Yukihiro Matsumoto in 1993 in Japan.
        It is what we call an OOP, Object Oriented Programming.</p>

      <h3>Data types: Numbers, Strings, Boolean</h3>
      <p>In Ruby, your information (or data) can come in different types.
        There are three data types in Ruby that we're interested in right now:<br>
        - Integer : any number üî¢<br>
        - Boolean : true or false üëå<br>
        - Strings : any text üÜí</p>

        <h3>Strings</h3>
        <p>In programming a string is a representation of text. Every time we want to display something
          on the screen we need to write our text as a string. To do that we need to encapsulate our text
          with single or double quotes exactly like this: "This is a string" or 'This is a string'.</p>

        <h3>Integers</h3>
        <p>Integers in programming are basically numbers. Numbers don't need to be encapsulated
          like text so you can simply write the number you want and it will be displayed on the screen.<br>
          You can do all the classical operation you learned at school with the integer.<br>
          There are 4 main arithmetic operators we're going to focus on: Addition, Subtraction, Division, Multiplication. In addition to this, there is
          also a modulo operator : % which is to the left over of an division.<br>
          So for example 5 % 3 = 2.
          Finally, you can also use exponents in Ruby by using **.<br>
          For example : 2 ** 3 = 8</p>

        <h3>Booleans</h3>
        <p>In programming the Boolean Data Type is a data type that has two possible values intended to represent
          the two truth values: True or False.<br>
          If we want to check if a person is hungry for example we can use a
          boolean value to output whether that person is hungry or not.<br>
          Example: person.is_hungry? True</p>

        <h3>Variables</h3>
        <p>One of the most basic concepts in computer programming is a variable.
          You can think of a variable as a word or name that grasps a single value.<br>
          For example, let's say you needed the number 25 multiple times, you can just
          store it in a variable and that variable will remember the number 25 for you.<br>
          To create a variable you simply need to give a name to the variable, put
          an equal sign and on the right hand side put the data that you want to store.<br>
          Example: name = "Codagram" name is the variable which is storing the "Codagram" string.<br>
          or: age = 10 age is the variable which is storing the integer 10.</p>


        <h3>'puts' and 'print'</h3>
        <p>The puts and print command just take whatever you give it and prints it to the screen.<br>
            In fact displaying "Hello World" on the screen is super simple. You just need to upcase
            either puts or print command and write next to it whatever you would like to display.<br>
            The main difference between puts and print is that puts adds a newline after executing and print does not.<br>
            To ouput Hello World you can just do: puts "Hello World" and it will appears on the screen.</p>

          <h3>The '.length' method</h3>
          <p> Methods are used to give some behaviour to the object we are working with. We say that we are calling a method on an object. A method will always be called on an object with a.<br>
            If you have a string and you feel lazy to count how long is that string,
            then comes in handy the .length method. You can simply use this method to output the exact number of characters contained in that string.<br>
            Example: we have "Hello World", to count the length of this string we can simply do: "Hello World".length and it will output
            the number 11 (it also counts spaces).<br>
            Pretty simple, right?
            You can also use this method on array, that we gonna speak about on the next topic.</p>

        <h3>Arrays</h3>
        <p>Arrays are ways to store data inside the code. They are like a list of data.<br>
          An example of a variable storing an array would be a = [195, "Hello World", true].<br>
          Arrays can store any type of data. They can even store other arrays!. This one stores an integer, a string
          and a boolean value.<br>
          If you do a[0], the output would be 195 as array's index starts from 0 and count onwards.<br><br>
          You could also add data into an array by using the .push method.<br>
          For example if we do a.push([1,2]), the new array would
          be a = [195,"Hello World",true,[1,2]]. <br>
          The .delete method does the opposite exact of the .push method.

        <h3>Hashes</h3>
        <p>Hashes are similar to arrays in that they hold data.<br>
          However, they are using a key/value pair. It is a bit like a dictionary.<br>
          You can access a specific value in a hash by searching up its key.<br>
          An example of this would be : h = { "Ferrari" => "sport car", "color" => "red", "symbol" => "horse", "doors" => 2 }.<br>
          If we type : puts h[Ferrari], the output will be sport car.

        <h3>The '.reverse' method</h3>
        <p>The .reverse method is called the same way as .length is, but instead of asking Ruby to tell you how long a string is,
          it spits out a backwards version of the string you gave it. It can also be called on an array.
          For instance, we have our string "Hello World"
          and we want to have it reversed, we can use the .reverse method.<br>
          Example: "Hello World".reverse will output 'dlroW olleH'.</p>

        <h3>'.upcase' & '.downcase'</h3>
        <p>Let's try one more method. As you might have guessed, the .upcase and .downcase methods convert a string to ALL
          UPPER CASE or all lower case, respectively.<br>
          Example: "Hello World".upcase will output HELLO WORLD
          "HELLO WORLD".lowcase will output hello world</p>

        <h3>Inbuilt methods</h3>
        <p>There are a huge number of inbuilt methods in Ruby. This means you can access them without ever typing a word. An example of this would be
          the methods .include? or .start_with?<br>
          Both of these return a boolean value.<br>
          The first method checks whether or not the value we will write after the method is included anywhere in the object.<br>
          The second method checks wether or not the string starts with the value given after the method.<br>
          Example : "Dog".start_with? "D" will output true

        <h3>Classes</h3>
        <p>Imagine you are an object that is an instance of the class Person. In a certain way, you actually are. Let me explain better.<br>
          Let's say that a class is something inside what you can wrap the same things. In our case the class will be person and inside will be wrapped all the persons in the world.<br>
          Since you are a person, you are able to remember your own name and able to do something with it.
          When asked, you can return your name to whoever called it. In the same way, methods can interact with instances of classes.<br>
          To create a class, you have to write the keyword class followed by the class name you want to give starting by a capital letter. Then inside you can wrap what you want.
          To close the class after what you have wrapped inside, you should juste the keyword end.</p>

        <h3>Comments</h3>
        <p>The '#' sign is used to make comments. A comment is a bit of text that Ruby won't try to run when you run the code. It can be useful to use to remember something that you   have done for example.<br>
          Example: #this is a comment and it will not appears on the screen</p>
