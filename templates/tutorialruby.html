    <h1>Learning the basic of Ruby programming language</h1>

    <div class="introduction">
      <p>Ruby is a programming language, and yes also a precious stone!
        It is considered as a good option to start with because it is designed to be
        read and written almost like English.
        This language was created by Yukihiro Matsumoto in 1993 in Japan.
        It is an OOP, Object Oriented Programming.</p>

      <h3>Data types: Numbers, Strings, Boolean</h3>
      <p>In Ruby, your information (or data) can come in different types.
        There are three data types in Ruby that we're interested in right now:
        Integer (any number), Boolean (which can be true or false), Strings (any text).</p>

        <h3>Strings</h3>
        <p>In programming a string is a representation of text. Every time we want to display something
          on the screen we need to write our text as a string. To do that we need to encapsulate our text
          from single or double quotes exactly like this: "This is a string".</p>

        <h3>Integers</h3>
        <p>Integers in programming are basically numbers. Numbers don't need to be encapsulated
          like text so you can simply write the number you want and it will be displayed on the screen.</p>

        <h3>Booleans</h3>
        <p>In programming the Boolean Data Type is a data type that has two possible values intended to represent
          the two truth values: True or False. If we want to check if a person is hungry for example we can use a
          boolean value to output whether that person is hungry or not. Example: is_hungry? True</p>

        <h3>Variables</h3>
        <p>One of the most basic concepts in computer programming is a variable.
          You can think of a variable as a word or name that grasps a single value.
          For example, let's say you needed the number 25 multiple times, you can just
          store it in a variable and that variable will remember the number 25 for you.
          To create a variable you simply need to give a name to the variable, put
          an equal sign and on the right hand side put the data that you want to store.
          Example: name = 'Codagram' to store a string or: age = 10 to store a number.</p>

        <h3>Arrays</h3>
        <p>Arrays are ways to store data inside the code. An example of a variable equating an array would be
          a = [195,"Hello World",true]. Arrays can store any type of data, even other arrays!. This one stores an integer, a string
          and a boolean value. If you print a[0], the output would be 195 as arrays start from 0 and count onwards.
          You could also add things into the array with the .push method. For example if we did a.push([1,2]), the new array would
          be a = [195,"Hello World",true,[1,2]]. The .delete method does the opposite of the .push method.

        <h3>The .push and .delete methods</h3>
        <p>You could also add things into the array with the .push method. Take the example above for instance.If we did a.push([1,2]), the new array would
        be a = [195,"Hello World",true,[1,2]]. The .delete method does the opposite of the .push method. If we did a.delete[0] or a.delete(195), the new array
        would be a = ["Hello World",true,[1,2]].</p>

        <h3>Hashes</h3>
        <p>Hashes are similar to arrays in that they hold data. However, you can access specific values in it by searching up its index. Perfect for online dictionaries!
          An example of this would be dictionary = { "one" => "uno", "two" => "dos", "three" => "tres" }. If we type puts dictionary["one"], the output will be uno.

        <h3>Math</h3>
        <p>Ruby can do a lot of powerfull things that you will discover. Ruby can also do
          all the math you learned about in school. There are 4 main arithmetic operators we're going
          to focus on: Addition, Subtraction, Division, Multiplication. In addition to this, there is
          also a % operator which equates to the remainder of an operation. So for example 5 % 3 = 2.
          Finally, you can also use exponents in Ruby by using **</p>

        <h3>'puts' and 'print'</h3>
        <p>The 'puts' and 'print' command just take whatever you give it and prints it to the screen.
          In fact displaying "Hello World" on the screen is super simple. You just need to upcase
          either 'puts' or 'print' command and write next to it whatever you would like to display.
          To print Hello World on the screen you can just do: puts 'Hello World' and it will appear on the screen.</p>

        <h3>The '.length' method</h3>
        <p> Methods are used to give some behaviour to our programs. If you have a string and you feel lazy to count how long is that string,
          then comes in handy the '.length' method. You can simply use this method to output the exact number of characters contained in that string.
          Example: we have 'Hello World', to count the length of this string we can simply do: 'Hello World'.length and it will output
          the number 11 (it also counts spaces). Pretty simple, right?</p>

        <h3>The '.reverse' method</h3>
        <p>The '.reverse' method is called the same way '.length' is, but instead of asking Ruby to tell you how long a string is,
          it spits out a backwards version of the string you gave it. For instance, we have our string 'Hello World'
          and we want to have it reversed, we can use the '.reverse' method.
          Example: 'Hello World'.reverse will output 'dlroW olleH'.</p>

        <h3>'.upcase' & '.downcase'</h3>
        <p>Let's try one more method (er, two methods). As you might have guessed, the '.upcase' and '.downcase' methods convert a string to ALL
          UPPER CASE or all lower case, respectively.
          Example: 'Hello World'.upcase will output 'HELLO WORLD'.</p>

        <h3>Inbuilt methods</h3>
        <p>There are a number of inbuilt methods in Ruby. This means you can access them without ever typing a word. An example of this would be
          the methods .include?() or .start_with?(). Both of these return a boolean value. The first method checks whether or not the object inside the parentheses
          is included anywhere in the object it's called on. On the other hand, the second method checks whether the value inside the parentheses is what starts
          the objects that is called.

        <h3>Classes</h3>
        <p>Imagine you were an object that is an instance of the class Person. In a certain way, you actually are. Since you are a person, you are able
          to remember your own name and able to do something with it. When asked, you can return your name to whoever called it. In the same way, methods
          can interact with instances of classes. In the code, every classes must have a keyword end that concludes its content. Typically, methods are used to
          interact with instances of classes in larger scale applications.</p>

        <h3>Comments</h3>
        <p>The '#' sign is for comments in Ruby. A comment is a bit of text that Ruby won't try to run as code: it's just for us to remember
          what is doing a piece of code in case we forget and for other programmers who want to collaborate on the same project.
          Example: #'this is a comment and will not appear on the screen'.</p>
