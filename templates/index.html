      Programming is becoming an essential skill in nearly every modern industry. In fact, it's predicted that by 2020 there will be 1,000,000 more computer science jobs than computer science students. Wow!
      But more than any of that, when taught correctly, programming can be a whole heap of fun! Learning to code is an amazing, practical and hugely rewarding hobby and skill for kids of all ages.
