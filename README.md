## Our approach ##

This project is done in a team of 4 people.<br/>
We are using these high level skills :<br/>
1. [XP values](#xp-values) to guide your behaviour<br/>
2. The full [developer workflow](#development-workflow) (Creating issues, branching, reviewing, squirrelling, merging.<br/>
3. Keeping code quality using *Travis* <br/>
4. Agile processes (diagram, morning/afternoon stand up, 2 days sprint (planning days (scrum methodology) - retro days), strict TDD principle, code pairing)

## Tech Stack ##
